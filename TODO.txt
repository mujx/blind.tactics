### Game ideas

- Color of Square
- 2 Knights
- Same diagonal
- Colliding pieces
- Tactics with 30 second timer
- Tactics with arrows N-moves
- Move piece without capture (enumeration)
- Play moves from the opening and solve the position
- Minimum moves (knights, enumeration)
- Minimum moves (bishop, enumeration)
- Studies (endgame < 7 pieces, full lines)
- Find all captures (empty board)
- Find all checks (empty board)
- How can a piece arrive from X to Y
- Say all routes from X to Y
- Name the diagonals that intersect in X, Y, Z
- Name the color that diagonals intersect
- Opening traps
- Can piece at X capture piece at Y? In 1 move? In 2 moves? etc
